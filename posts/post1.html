    <p>Hey there! Before you dive into future posts — or click away — let me quickly introduce myself and share what this blog is all about.</p>

    <p>I'm a programmer from Germany with a strong passion for cybersecurity. I love building tools that help others and exploring new ideas that stretch my skills and imagination. My GitHub repositories show the results of these projects, but this blog aims to show something more: the journey.</p>

    <p>One of my biggest inspirations is <a href="https://github.com/SebLague">Sebastian Lague</a>. Watching his projects evolve through his videos has always been incredibly motivating. While I can't currently produce videos myself, I can still tell stories — in code and in words. That’s the heart of this blog: a space to share my process, thoughts, experiments, and discoveries as I explore the world of software and cybersecurity.</p>

    <p>So whether you’re a fellow coder, a curious beginner, or just someone who stumbled across this blog — welcome! I hope you find something here that sparks your interest. Feel free to explore, get inspired, and maybe even start a project of your own.</p>

    <p>Got project ideas, feedback, or just want to say hi? Send me a message at <a href="mailto:constantin.reinhold@gmx.net">constantin.reinhold@gmx.net</a>. I'd love to hear from you!</p>
